This article is about tech startups. It's directed primarily at founders and early engineering hires who will often on weekends and after hours on week days to "get things over the line". This is not an article about other sectors, like video game development with it's notorious crunch culture, because I don't have experience in there. Though I have a feeling these lessons may apply equally well there. This is also not directed at workers mandated to do so, such as the companies embracing the ridiculous [9-9-6](https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-china-996-work-schedule/) work schedule.

If you are one of these workers, I believe you deserve better, but this article is about your leadership and those that drive the after hours work culture, not those subjected to it against their will. As a former (and possibly future, stay tuned) founder, I know well the temptation to grind out some more code after hours. I know the hustle lifestyle. Over the course of my career I have learned that this is not a good instinct. You will only hamper yourself and your startup by constantly working overtime.

# All work and no play...

Coding, design, product ideation, and other tech startup jobs are primarily about using your brain. And when work long brain not work good. I've repeatedly found that I do my worst thinking when I am unrested. I think this is true of everyone. One of the best ways for me to solve a finicky problem is to go to bed and think about it in the shower the next morning. Frequently a problem with my approach will become apparent and a much simpler path will become clear.

# Fixation

When I'm tired, I don't think through problems as well as when I'm rested. I also find that the longer I work the more fixated I get. Whatever thing I'm currently doing, whatever solution I'm currently entertaining, becomes the only way I interface with the problem. Generally, working for a long time on a single solution is an indication that the solution may not be the right one. Maybe, instead of a large engineering change, you should actually make a small UX change. Or you should reach for an off the shelf solution rather than rolling your own.

Fixation on one solution is correlated with time spent on that solution. The sunk cost fallacy is extremely hard to shake. In my experience, I can realize that I'm approaching something the wrong way by banging my head on it all night and only then realizing it's the wrong move, or I can go to bed and realize first thing in the morning. THis is the part where I should link to those articles about how your brain rewires itself while you sleep, but I'll spare us all the classic half assed citation from a tech blog and stick with speaking from personal experience.

# But I need to get this feature out tonight!

Do you? **DO YOU**? Deadlines in software, especially in startups, are almost entirely self imposed. We decide we want to get something done by the end of the week because we think we can get it done by the end of the week. While enterprise contracts with delivery deadlines and distributed software release dates do exist, most startups embracing a crunch culture right now do not have these. Most are doing incremental rolling releases, often daily or weekly, and don't have an enterprise contract yet.

Most of the time when I've been asked to get something done by a certain date it's because someone else decided that date was special without consulting me. Often from marketing or sales. Frankly speaking, these people are operating outside of their purview. They do not understand software development lifecycles, much less have the authority to decide them. When a marketer says they need something by X date, your first question should be why? Who chose that date? If they chose a date before consulting you, they've acted irresponsibly and will need to face the embarrassment of walking back a public release on their own, rather than pinning it on you.

If engineering was involved in setting this deadline and it could not be met in working hours it means your process is bad and that's what needs to be fixed. You don't need a crunch session, you need a retro.

# But I need to demo this feature to secure this new client!

News flash: you should not be demoing features that were just released. I know, heresy, right? When doing a sales call you should only be showing off stable features or mockups. There's nothing worse than demoing something broken because it went out at 9pm the night before and the developer fell asleep with their face in a bowl of cold Chipotle before they could do QA. If something can't be released and QAed on working hours then it can't be relied upon to meet quality standards. Further, you're better off going into the demo with design mockups anyway, as that will let you learn if the feature is worth building at all. If the prospective customer is so excited they beg to get their hands on it as soon as possible, that's when you truly know it's time to refocus the team.

# But I love my work!

Sure. I do to. I've spent many nights working late on something purely because it was what I wanted to be doing in that moment. Sometimes solving a problem really is better than any other hobby. But it has a cost. You will burn out spending 12 hours a day coding. You will slowly start to despise your project and even come to resent coding as a whole. Human brains really aren't built to do one thing all day every day.

That spark of enjoyment and pride in your work is perhaps the most valuable thing to progress your company and your career. You **will** get ahead purely because your enjoyment will propel you to learn more and work faster than others. The existential risk here is losing that joy. Close the laptop at 5PM and you'll wake up the next day excited to start working.

# But I'm built different!

No, you're not. Everyone *can* work a 7 day week. Ever heard of *parents*? Believing yourself to be just better than those around you will only cloud your judgment further. You will not just lose your ability to think through problems with a lack of rest you will lose your ability to empathize and understand others. As you become less rested and more fixated, you will start to resent those who don't work the hours you do. You'll think they are being lazy. Not devoted enough to the cause. Not willing to do what it takes.

Declining to have a social or family life because you think you need to win now are not healthy. You will only become more insulated to the world around you. You will reject different patterns of thought and fail to see opportunities. You will marginalize the best employees in your workplace, the ones who ensure they are spending enough time away from work to keep their heads on straight.

# But I want to get ahead!

I get it. You're young. You're in a fast moving company. You have the opportunity to move up quickly, perhaps be a manager, director, or principal IC within a few years out of college. Let me tell you right now, if you have a reasonable manager, number of hours worked won't be the thing that gets you into those higher echelons. Your manager doesn't want the person who can write the most react components leading the team, he wants the person who will write **the fewest**. Not because they are being lazy, but because they can think about the codebase in a way to prevent duplication, prevent unnecessary work, and save everyone time in the future.

True seniority really isn't a volume measurement it's a measurement of efficiency. Efficiency is best arrived at by reducing work for your teammates, removing blockers, and setting things up for the long term. You will ascend as you learn how to best support your teammates. Meeting artificial deadlines will look good but won't help you stand out.

That's not to say that there aren't companies that reward purely on volume. The issue is that a promotion there won't do you any good. Eventually you will burn out and get resentful, and when you start to look for other jobs you'll find that sheer output won't help you get through an interview process. You need to look for jobs with Senior in the title so you aren't moving down diagonally, but you haven't gained the experience solving problems, creating abstractions, and leveling up teams that other companies will expect from a senior hire.

If you want to get a head, working late won't do much for you. Focus on getting mentorship from the smartest people. Seek out problems that aren't getting voiced. Message someone from customer support to ask if there's anything really annoying in their workflow. Ask your coworkers what the worst part of their day is. Solve problems like that and not only will you learn new things quickly but you will quickly gain recognition and support from around the organization.

# But the site is down!

Fine. Fix it. Then, more importantly, block off your Monday to do a post mortem. Your primary goal when something goes terribly wrong is to make sure it never happens again.

Did someone deploy a bug late friday night? Restrict deploys off of working hours and improve QA or testing.

Did the site get DDoSed? Implement a DDoS protection service like Cloudflare.

Was this a latent issue in the code that was bound to happen eventually? Figure out how it made it through code review, increase standards, and require more tests for critical functionality.

All of these are solvable process or technical problems. They are problems every company must eventually solve in order to be a reliable solution for customers. If you consider it normal to work on weekends you will gaslight yourself into believing you can solve availability by just being available yourself at all hours of the day. Eventually this won't work. You can't (or shouldn't) interrupt your best friend's wedding to fix the site. You will forget to charge your phone and sleep through the downtime detector call.

The growth of your business will naturally shrink your personal impact. You have to begin setting up patterns and habits that will work once the code is largely written by other people before you relinquish your duty as chief coder.

# Wrapping up

Eventually, the hyper-engaged 22 year olds who you rely on to work overtime will run out of steam. You'll start hiring senior staff who know their stuff but strangely like to spend their nights weekends with their families. If you convince yourself that regardless, you need to be working all hours of each day, you're just going to become a worse leader.
